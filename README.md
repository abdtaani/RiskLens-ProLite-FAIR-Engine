🛡️ RiskLens ProLite: Cybersecurity Financial Risk Quantification Engine (FAIR)
🌟 Project Overview
RiskLens ProLite is an advanced, integrated security analysis tool designed to bridge the gap between technical security findings and executive decision-making.

By implementing the globally recognized FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) model, this solution quantitatively transforms security incidents (detected in logs) into meaningful financial risk metrics, providing the Annualized Loss Exposure (ALE).

The core value is simple: We answer the critical business question: "What is the expected financial loss from our cyber risks?"

💡 Methodology: Quantifying Risk with FAIR and Monte Carlo
The project's strength lies in its adherence to quantitative risk analysis standards:

Component	Description	Implementation in RiskLens ProLite
FAIR Model	A standard for measuring information risk in financial terms (Loss Magnitude, Loss Event Frequency).	The entire project structure is built around the FAIR framework.
Monte Carlo Simulation	Used to run 
10,000+
 scenarios to account for uncertainty in loss estimations.	Executed within fair_engine.py using scipy.stats.triang for probabilistic modeling.
ALE Calculation	The final metric: the probable financial loss over a year.	Calculated from the simulation results, providing mean, min, and max risk ranges.
Executive Reporting	Generates detailed, professional PDF reports ready for C-level presentation.	Managed by exporter.py, leveraging ReportLab and Matplotlib for data visualization.

🏗️ Project Architecture & Key Modules
The application follows a clean, modular design:

File/Module	Primary Function	Highlight / Innovation
main.py	Command-Line Interface (CLI) Orchestrator.	Coordinates the full analysis pipeline from config loading to report generation.
log_reader.py	Log Data Ingestion.	Reads and parses raw logs (Windows EVTX, Syslog) into structured Pandas DataFrames.
analyzer.py	Incident Detection Engine.	Identifies security incidents using customizable Regex patterns, Event IDs, and Time/Count Thresholds from config.json.
fair_engine.py	The Core Risk Engine.	Implements the FAIR model and Monte Carlo simulation to quantify risk.
exporter.py	Reporting and Output.	Generates professional reports in PDF (executive summary), CSV, and JSON formats.
config.json	Configuration File.	Stores all detection rules and the financial input parameters (Min/Max Loss, Frequencies) for the FAIR engine.

⚡ Getting Started
Prerequisites
You need Python 3.8+ installed.

Installation
Install all required Python packages (including scipy, pandas, reportlab, etc.):

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Execution
Run the main application by providing the configuration file and the log files:

Bash

python main.py --config config.json --windows-log-file path/to/windows_events.evtx --syslog-file path/to/syslog.log
📈 Example Key Findings (From Test Data)
The analysis clearly identifies the most significant risks:

Incident Type	Incident Count	Expected Annual Loss Exposure (ALE)	Max Risk Range (P95)
Privilege Escalation	827	$289,758,275	$507,480,166
Failed Login Attempts	65	$457,652	$810,064

Actionable Insight: The financial quantification clearly prioritizes Privilege Escalation as the top risk, demanding immediate and focused mitigation efforts.

🗺️ Future Roadmap
Live Log Connectors: Fully implement API connectors for enterprise SIEM/Log Management platforms (e.g., Splunk, Azure Sentinel) currently stubbed out in log_reader.py.

Behavioral Detection: Enhance analyzer.py with Anomaly Detection capabilities to identify unknown threats beyond static Regex patterns.

Web Interface: Develop a simple, interactive web dashboard (using Streamlit or Flask) to display FAIR risk charts and simulation results dynamically.
