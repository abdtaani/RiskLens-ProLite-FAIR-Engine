💰 RiskLens ProLite: Quantifying Cyber Risk in Financial Terms (FAIR Engine)
⭐ Project Summary: Bridging Security and Business
RiskLens ProLite is a cutting-edge security analysis tool designed to solve a critical business problem: transforming technical vulnerabilities into monetary loss projections.

It moves security analysis beyond simple incident counting ("We had 892 incidents") to providing quantifiable financial risk metrics ("The expected annual loss is $289 Million"). This allows executives to make data-driven decisions on security budgeting, resource allocation, and mitigation prioritization.

💡 The Core Idea: Why Quantitative Risk (FAIR)?
Our project utilizes the globally adopted FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) framework and Monte Carlo Simulation to establish a financially-based risk language.

Traditional Method (Qualitative)	RiskLens ProLite (Quantitative - FAIR)
❌ "High Risk"                                     	✅ $289,758,275    Expected Annual Loss (ALE)
❌ Focus on Vulnerabilities	             ✅ Focus on Financial Impact and Loss Exposure
❌ Based on Gut Feeling	                          ✅ Based on Probabilistic Modeling (Monte Carlo)

This methodology is the innovation that makes the project highly valuable in any professional setting.

🛠️ Key Features and Architecture
The project is built around a modular pipeline to ensure efficiency and scalability:

Log Ingestion (log_reader.py): Reads and parses raw security logs (Windows EVTX, Syslog).

Incident Detection (analyzer.py): Uses configurable rules (config.json) to accurately identify security incidents (e.g., Failed Logins, Suspicious Processes).

FAIR Risk Engine (fair_engine.py): The heart of the project. It processes incident frequency and loss magnitude inputs using 10,000+ Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the Annualized Loss Exposure (ALE).

Executive Reporting (exporter.py): Generates clear, professional PDF Reports (ready for C-level presentation) and exports raw data (CSV/JSON).

📊 Sample Impact
The analysis provides immediate strategic priorities by highlighting the financial impact:

Incident Type	Detected Count	Annual Loss Exposure (ALE)	Max Loss Projection
Privilege Escalation      	827	         $289,758,275	                            $507,480,166
Failed Login Attempts	65	   $457,652	                            $810,064

Conclusion: Mitigation efforts must be focused on Privilege Escalation as it carries the highest financial risk burden.

🚀 Future Enhancements
The next steps for this project focus on real-time integration and advanced detection:

Live Connectors: Full implementation of API connectors for Splunk, Sentinel, and Elastic for real-time data fetching.

Behavioral Analysis: Integrating behavioral detection techniques to find Zero-Day threats not covered by static rules.
